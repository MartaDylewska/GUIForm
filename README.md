Form with fields validation, random password generation and tests<br>
Main frame allows you to enter your data and generate random password using special button. The password must meet expected requirements (length between 8 and 16 characters, must contain at least one capital letter, one number, one special character, one lowercase letter)<br>

After user enters the data, he can click "Submit". After that, a list of errors comes up in a separate window<br>
![formErrors](https://github.com/MartaDylewska/GUIForm/blob/master/src/main/resources/FormErrors.PNG)<br>
After confirming, on the main page the fields are marked with red asterix<br>

Apart from standard tests to check for password validity, there are also other tests that check whether the random password generator generates full spectrum of characters.
